            <p>Hi, I’m Santosh Kumar Mishra, an MCA student at GIFT College, currently placed at Surya International Private Limited. My journey into tech began with learning C programming, and I later completed an internship in Java, which solidified my interest in software development.

                Now, I’m diving deep into web development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React.js. Each day is a new opportunity to build, experiment, and grow as a developer.
                
                When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring ideas, solving problems, and keeping up with the fast-paced world of technology. My portfolio is a reflection of my dedication, curiosity, and continuous learning mindset.
                
                Let’s connect as I navigate and contribute to the dynamic world of web development!</p>
